# Welcome to PistonProtection

PistonProtection is an enterprise-grade DDoS protection platform powered by eBPF/XDP technology. It provides sub-millisecond packet filtering at line rate, protecting your infrastructure from volumetric attacks.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: XDP filters process packets at the NIC level before they reach the kernel network stack
- **Protocol Aware**: Deep packet inspection for TCP, UDP, QUIC, HTTP, and Minecraft protocols
- **Kubernetes Native**: Deploy with Helm, scale with operators, and integrate with Cilium
- **Real-time Analytics**: Grafana dashboards and Prometheus metrics for complete visibility
- **Multi-tenant**: Organization support with role-based access control

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add the Helm repository
helm repo add pistonprotection https://charts.pistonprotection.io

# Install PistonProtection
helm install pistonprotection pistonprotection/pistonprotection \
  --namespace pistonprotection \
  --create-namespace
```

## Architecture Overview

PistonProtection consists of several components:

1. **Worker Nodes**: Run eBPF/XDP programs for packet filtering
2. **Gateway**: API gateway for management and configuration
3. **Auth Service**: Authentication and authorization with better-auth
4. **Metrics Service**: Collect and aggregate metrics from workers
5. **Config Manager**: Distribute configuration to workers
6. **Kubernetes Operator**: Manage custom resources
